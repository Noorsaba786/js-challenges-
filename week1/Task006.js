//create a function to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle

let length = 4;
let width = 6;

let area = length * width; // area formula and the basic formula is length multiplied by width 
let perimeter = 2 * (length + width); // corrected formula for perimeter and the basic formula is 2 multiplied by the sum of length and width in persain we call it "mohit"

console.log("Area:", area);
console.log("Perimeter:", perimeter);
